# Upcoming Update

Discord is currently [recommending that all Discord bots switch to slash commands](https://support-dev.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/4404772028055).
As the result, Sniper will, at some point, stop supporting message commands.

## Changes you need to make

As a server owner, the only changes that will need to be made is ensuring that Sniper has permissions to register slash commands in your server.
To do this, **simply run through the [setup steps](./setup.md)** again.
This involves re-inviting Sniper with the `applications.commands` permission, which allows Sniper to register commands in your server.
