## Data Storage

Sniper will only store the most recently deleted message, reaction and last edit for every channel, and this data will be automatically removed after 1 hour. When the `/unsnipe` command is used, all storage of the most recently deleted message is removed. When the bot is restarted, all message, message reaction, and message edit data is removed.

If a user wishes for none of their message data to be stored, they can use the `/optout` command.

## User Information

The only user information that is stored is the user id (which anyone can view) and the most recent user tag.
