## Data Storage

Sniper will only store the most recently deleted message, reaction and last edit for every channel.

When the `unsnipe` command is used, all storage of the most recently deleted message is removed.

When the bot is restarted, all message, message reaction, and message edit data is removed.

## User Information

The only user information that is stored is the user id (which anyone can view) and the most recent user tag.
